  <p>
  Some minor problems that prevented j from working correctly with the Java 1.5
  betas are fixed in this release.
  <p>
  It is now possible to use drag/drop in the sidebar buffer list to reorder the
  buffers, so that navigating between buffers using
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#nextBuffer">nextBuffer</a> and
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#prevBuffer">prevBuffer</a> (mapped by default to
  Alt Right and Alt Left, respectively) is more efficient. Thanks to Mike
  Rutter for providing the code to do this.
  <p>
  By request, the command
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#wrapParagraphsInRegion">wrapParagraphsInRegion</a>
  has been added. It is mapped by default to Ctrl Shift F12 in plain text and
  mail composition buffers.
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#wrapParagraphsInRegion">wrapParagraphsInRegion</a>
  walks through the region (or the whole buffer if no region is selected) and,
  in effect, calls <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#wrapParagraph">wrapParagraph</a>
  on each paragraph.
  <p>
  The wrap commands should now do a better job of handling lines that break on
  the hyphen of a hyphenated word (like "wrap-paragraph"). If the paragraph is
  subsequently reformatted in such a way that the line break no longer falls on
  the hyphen in question, the parts of the hyphenated word are now put back
  together properly. In previous versions of j, you were likely to end up with
  "wrap- paragraph", with a bogus extra space after the hyphen.
  <p>
  The commands
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#pageUpOtherWindow">pageUpOtherWindow</a> and
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#pageDownOtherWindow">pageDownOtherWindow</a> have
  been added. They are mapped by default to Alt Page Down and Alt Page Up,
  respectively, in all modes. These commands are helpful in a split-window
  situation when you want to scroll the other window without switching to it.
  <p>
  The commmand
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#findOccurrenceAtDotAndKillList">findOccurrenceAtDotAndKillList</a>
  has been added. It is mapped by default to Ctrl Enter in List Occurrences
  buffers. It works like
  <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#findOccurrenceAtDot">findOccurrenceAtDot</a>, but
  in addition it closes the List Occurrences buffer.
  <p>
  The commands <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#shellNextPrompt">shellNextPrompt</a>
  and <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#shellPreviousPrompt">shellPreviousPrompt</a>
  have been added. They are mapped by default to Ctrl Alt N and Ctrl Alt P,
  respectively, in shell buffers and their derivatives (including Lisp shells),
  and they help you find the next or previous prompt, starting from the current
  location of the caret.
  <p>
  The command <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#p4Log">p4Log</a> has been added. It
  runs the Perforce command "filelog -l" on the file associated with the
  current buffer.
  <p>
  The command <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#p4Diff">p4Diff</a> now runs the
  Perforce command "p4 diff -f -du", instead of "p4 diff -du". This change
  means that <a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/doc/commands.html#p4Diff">p4Diff</a> will display
  potentially useful output even if the file associated with the current buffer
  has not, in Perforce's opinion, been officially opened for editing.
  <p>
  J's ssh-related code now recognizes "Response:" as a password prompt, in
  addition the to other password prompts it recognized already.
  <p>
  Compilation buffers are now supported on Windows NT 4. Thanks to Pete Kirkham
  for pointing out that this was possible.
  <p>
  In previous versions of j, there was an incorrect optimization in the display
  code which malfunctioned on very rare occasions and caused lines to disappear
  from the display, even though they were still present in the buffer (there
  was never any loss of data). This bug has been fixed by removing the
  optimization in question.
  <p>
  There are a number of new features and minor improvements in Lisp mode and
  in Lisp shells. Thanks to Sam Steingold for help with many of these.
  <p>
  This release includes version 0.0.4 of Armed Bear Common Lisp. ABCL 0.0.4
  passes 17778 out of 17942 tests in the GCL ANSI Common Lisp test suite, for a
  nominal compliance of 99.0859%. The test suite is still not complete,
  however, so ABCL's actual percentage of ANSI compliance, whatever that may
  mean, is undoubtedly lower. In any case, version 0.0.4 represents a
  substantial improvement over version 0.0.3, back when it was still called
  Armed Bear Lisp, which passed 12986 out of 14127 tests (91.92%).
  <p>
  ABCL includes a compiler, written in Lisp, that generates JVM bytecode from
  Lisp source. The compiler is not finished, and there are valid Lisp
  constructs that it doesn't know how to compile. In most situations, when the
  compiler encounters code that it can't compile correctly, it is smart enough
  to leave the code alone so that it will continue to work correctly with the
  interpreter. Compiled code and interpreted code can coexist happily in the
  same running instance of ABCL.
  <p>
  The 0.21.0 binary distribution contains a compiled version of the Lisp
  library code (i.e. a full set of .abcl and .cls files), as well as the Lisp
  source files for the library code that is implemented in Lisp. If you build j
  from source, using either configure/make or Ant, the Lisp library code will
  be compiled as part of the build. There is no longer any need to do
  COMPILE-SYSTEM manually.
  <p>
  ABCL 0.0.4 is better at some things than others. In particular, it's not very
  good at CLOS. ABCL's CLOS correctness is reasonable, but its CLOS performance
  is terrible (for one thing, the compiler doesn't even attempt to compile
  generic functions). This deficiency is due more to simple neglect than to any
  intrinsic limitation, and the CLOS implementation should improve in future
  releases.
  <p>
  You can start ABCL from within j by doing Alt X, "abcl", or by selecting "Run
  Lisp as Separate Process" from the Lisp menu. Note that the "Run Embedded
  Lisp" menu selection opens a Lisp shell using an instance of ABCL that runs
  in the editor process; it only makes sense to do this if you're planning to
  interact with the running instance of j, which is not normally the case. If
  you just want to experiment with ABCL, "Run Lisp as Separate Process" (or Alt
  X, "abcl") is your friend.
  <p>
  If you're truly adventurous, you can also start ABCL from within j by doing
  Alt X, "slime". J's version of slime is adapted from the "Superior Lisp
  Interaction Mode for Emacs", originally written by Eric Marsden, Luke Gorrie
  and Helmut Eller. Slime-for-j is less than a month old, so it is nowhere near
  as robust or featureful as slime-for-emacs, but in principle it offers more
  functionality than Alt X, "abcl". In particular, the tab key can be used for
  symbol completion, function argument lists are displayed in the status bar
  when you type a space, and Alt . should work to find function definitions (if
  you've built ABCL from source). In addition, the evaluation of forms and
  regions in Lisp source files makes an attempt to set *PACKAGE* to the right
  thing first. I don't think any of these features works 100% correctly yet,
  but even so, slime-for-j feels like an improvement over the basic Lisp shell
  functionality available in previous versions of j. For more information, see
  slime.lisp.
  <p>
