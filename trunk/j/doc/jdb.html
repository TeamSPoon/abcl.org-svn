<h1>The Java Debugger</h1>

<hr>

<p>

J provides a very simple JPDA-based debugger.
<p>
The command <a href="commands.html#jdb">jdb</a>
(Alt X, "jdb") starts the debugger. Enter the appropriate information in the
dialog box.
<p>
"Main class" is the fully qualified name of the main class of your
application. For example:
<pre>
    org.armedbear.j.Editor</pre>
<p>
"Arguments for main class" should contain any command-line arguments to be
passed to the application. For example:
<pre>
    --force-new-instance --no-session Lisp.java</pre>
<p>
The value you enter for "Class path" will be passed to the debuggee Java VM as
the "-classpath" option. Use the platform-specific path delimiter character
(':' for Unix, ';' for Windows). For example:
<pre>
    /home/peter/j/src</pre>
<p>
"Java home" is the value of JAVA_HOME for the debuggee VM. The default is
usually acceptable, unless you have some particular axe to grind.
<p>
The "Java executable" is normally just "java".
<p>
"Arguments for Java executable" should contain any command-line arguments to be
passed to the debuggee VM (for example, "-server"). Usually no arguments are
required.
<p>
If the "Start suspended" checkbox is checked, the Java VM will initially be
suspended, and you will need to use the "run" command to start it.
<p>
If the "Start suspended" checkbox is unchecked, the Java VM will start up
normally. In this case, if you don't have any breakpoints set, a breakpoint
will automatically be placed on the main() method of your application's main
class.
<p>
"Source path" should contain a list of the directories in which to look for the
Java source of the code being debugged. You should specify the root directory
of each package tree that you care about. Use the platform-specific path
delimiter character (':' for Unix, ';' for Windows). For example:
<pre>
    /home/peter/j/src:/home/peter/sun/j2sdk1.4.1_02/src</pre>
<p>
All of the textfields in this dialog remember their most recent contents, and,
like most textfields in j, they have persistent history that can be navigated
with the up and down arrows (or Ctrl P and Ctrl N).
<p>
When you finally click the "OK" button or press Enter, the debugger process
will start. You'll get a transcript buffer in the lower half of the current
editor frame, and a modeless control dialog will appear as a separate,
always-on-top top-level window (if you put it somewhere convenient, it will try
to remember where it belongs).
