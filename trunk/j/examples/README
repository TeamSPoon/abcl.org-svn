Building and running instructions
=================================

by Blake McBride

In general, to compile a Java class file (like Main.java for example)
use:

	javac  -cp  ../../../abcl.jar  Main.java

where the "../../../" represents the path to your abcl.jar file.

This compiles the Java source file "Main.java" into a JVM runtime or
class file named "Main.class".

To run the example (Main.class for example) from a Unix-like OS use:

	java  -cp  ../../../abcl.jar:.  Main

or in Windows use:

	java  -cp  ../../../abcl.jar;.  Main

where "Main" is the initial class to run in your Java program.
