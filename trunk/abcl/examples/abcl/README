ABCL Examples Building and Running Instructions
===============================================

In general, to compile a Java class file (like Main.java for example
in the 'java_exception_in_lisp' subdirectory) use:

	cmd$ cd java_exception_in_lisp
	cmd$ javac  -cp ../../../dist/abcl.jar  Main.java

where the "../../../dist/abcl.jar" represents the path to your
abcl.jar file, which is built via the Ant based build.  This path
could be slightly different depending on how the system was
constructed, and possibly due to operating system conventions for
specifying relative paths.  However you resolve this locally, we'll
refer to this as '$ABCL_ROOT/dist/abcl.jar' for the rest of these
instructions.

This compiles the Java source file "Main.java" into a JVM runtime or
class file named "Main.class".

To run the example (Main.class for example) from a Unix-like OS use:

	cmd$ java  -cp $ABCL_ROOT/dist/abcl.jar:.  Main

or in Windows use:

	cmd$  java  -cp  $ABCL_ROOT/dist/abcl.jar;.  Main

where "Main" is the initial class to run in your Java program.


abcl_appengine
==============

This example shows how to run your servlet off ABCL in general
and in Google App Engine (GAE) in particular.

When uploading your code to the server, be sure to put abcl.jar
in war/WEB-INF/lib.
