Google App Engine
=================

Running ABCL in a Google App Engine container.

This example shows how to run your Java servlet off ABCL in general
and in Google App Engine (GAE) in particular.

When uploading your code to the server, be sure to put abcl.jar
in war/WEB-INF/lib.


Running Locally
---------------

1.  Download the [Google App Engine SDK for Java][1], unzipping the
    distribution somewhere on your filesystem
    (e.g. "~/work/appengine-java-sdk-1.4.3").

[1]: http://googleappengine.googlecode.com/files/appengine-java-sdk-1.4.3.zip

2.  Simply invoke Ant on the `build.xml' in this directory with the
    `runserver' target, setting the `sdk.dir' JVM property to specify
    the location of the SDK.

        unix$ ant -Dsdk.dir=$HOME/work/appengine-java-sdk-1.4.3/ runserver

3.  Visit `http://localhost:8080/hello' in a web browser to see the example run.


Deploying to GAE
----------------

1.  To deploy the included example to GAE, you need to first obtain a
    GAE account, and pick a GAE application id to use with the
    application.

2.  Then you need to edit 'war/WEB-INF/appengine-web.xml' to specify
    this application.  Just replace the contents of the <applciation>
    tag (initially 'GAE-APPLICATION-ID-GOES-HERE') in the file with
    your GAE ID. 

3.  Then the Ant task 'update' should upload your application to GAE:

        unix$ ant update

    You will be prompted for the Google Account credentials associated
    with the application ID.
