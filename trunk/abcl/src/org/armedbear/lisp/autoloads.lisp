;; This file lists public functions which package users can depend upon.
;;
;; In order to avoid loading the full CL system (of which not all functions
;; may be required by the current program), this file makes sure the symbols
;; are available, but when it tries to execute them, the autoloader causes
;; the actual functions or macros to be loaded.

;; This file lists for each autoloaded symbol which file has to be
;; REQUIRE'd to make it available.
;;
;; Please note: the actual function definition may not be always in the
;;    same file as the one which needs to be REQUIRE'd; an example of
;;    such a case is the compiler: all compiler functions have to be
;;    loaded through loading jvm.lisp.
