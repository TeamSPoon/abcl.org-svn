;;; Sharp-equal works as follows. When a label is assigned (i.e. when

;;; unforgeable tag. *SHARP-SHARP-ALIST* maps the integer tag to this
;;; gensym.
;;;
;;; When SHARP-SHARP encounters a reference to a label, it returns the
;;; symbol assoc'd with the label. Resolution of the reference is
;;; deferred until the read done by #= finishes. Any already resolved
;;; tags (in *SHARP-EQUAL-ALIST*) are simply returned.
;;;
;;; After reading of the #= form is completed, we add an entry to
;;; *SHARP-EQUAL-ALIST* that maps the gensym tag to the resolved
;;; object. Then for each entry in the *SHARP-SHARP-ALIST, the current
;;; object is searched and any uses of the gensysm token are replaced
;;; with the actual value.
