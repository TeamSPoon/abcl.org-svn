GENERAL INFORMATION
===================

Armed Bear Common Lisp is an implementation of ANSI Common Lisp that
runs in a Java virtual machine.  It compiles its code to Java byte code.

BUILDING
========

If you want to build ABCL, you have 3 options. The first option
applies when you come from a lisp background. The second and thirds
options are more appropriate when you come from Java development:

 I)  Bootstrap ABCL using a Common Lisp implementation
     Supported implementations for this process: SBCL, CMUCL, OpenMCL,
     Allegro CL, LispWorks or CLISP.

II)  Use the Ant make-like build tool for Java environments
     The tested lowest working version is Ant 1.7.0.

III) Use the Netbeans 6.x IDE to open ABCL as a project.


In both cases you need a supported JDK version (1.5 and 1.6 have been
tested).  Just the JRE isn't enough.



I. Lisp-based build
-------------------

Copy the file 'customizations.lisp.in' to customization.lisp', in the
directory containing this README file, editing to suit your situation,
paying attention to the comments in the file.


Use ./build-from-lisp.sh <lisp-of-choice>, e.g.

  ./build-from-lisp.sh sbcl

Use abcl.bat on Windows or ./abcl on Unix to start ABCL.
Note: abcl.bat and abcl contain absolute paths, so you'll need
to edit them if you move things around after the build.


If you're developing on ABCL, you may want to use

  ./build-from-lisp.sh <implementation> --clean=nil

to not do a full rebuild.


In case of failure in the javac stage, you might try this:

  ./build-from-lisp.sh <implementation> --full=t --clean=t --batch=nil

This invokes javac separately for each .java file, which avoids running
into limitations on command line length (but is a lot slower).


II. Ant-based build
-------------------

With Ant in your path, executing

    ant -find build.xml abcl.wrapper

from the directory containing this README file will create an
executable wrapper ('abcl' under UNIX, 'abcl.bat' under Windows).
Use this wrapper to start the ABCL Java program.


III. Netbeans-based build
-------------------------

One should be able to open the project as a project in Netbeans 6.x.


BUGS
====

A lot of (renewed) energy has been spent to make ABCL a compliant
and practically useable Common Lisp implementation.  Because of this,
ABCL 0.0.11 now fails only 47 out of 21702 tests in the ANSI CL test
suite.  Next to that, the fail count of the Maxima test suite has been
reduced from over 1400 in 0.0.10 to little more than 600 in 0.0.11.

ABCL's CLOS does not handle on-the-fly redefinition of classes
correctly, and in any event is intolerably slow. There is no support
for the long form of DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION, and certain other
required CLOS features are also missing. Enough CLOS is there to run
ASDF and CL-PPCRE, if you're in no hurry.

There is no MOP worth mentioning.

Since this is a early public release, there might be build
problems as well as runtime bugs.

Please report problems to the j-devel mailing list:

    armedbear-j-devel@lists.sourceforge.net

Have fun!
