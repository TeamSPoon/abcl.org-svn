\title{A Manual for Armed Bear Common Lisp}

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Version}

This manual corresponds to abcl-0.26.0, as yet unreleased.

\section{Obtaining}

\subsection{Requirements}

java-1.5.xx, java-1.6.0_10+ recommended.

\subsection{Building from Source}
% TODO repeat install 

\subsection{Contributing}

\section{Interaction with host JVM}

% describe calling Java from Lisp, and calling Lisp from Java,
% probably in two separate sections.  Presumably, we can partition our
% audience into those who are more comfortable with Java, and those
% that are more comforable with Lisp

\subsection{Lisp to Java}

\subsection{Lisp from Java}

\subsection{JAVA}

% include autogen docs for the JAVA package.

\section{ANSI Common Lisp Conformance}

ABCL is currently a non-conforming ANSI Common Lisp implementation due
to the following (known) issues:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Lack of long form of DEFINE-METHOD-COMBINATION
  \item Missing statement of conformance in accompanying documentation
  \item Incomplete MOP 
    % TODO go through AMOP with symbols, starting by looking for
    % matching function signature.
\end{itemize}

ABCL aims to be be a fully conforming ANSI Common Lisp
implementation.  Any other behavior should be reported as a bug.

\section{Extensions}

% TODO document the EXTENSIONS package.

\section{Multithreading}

% TODO document the THREADS package.
